# Sequence-o-matic

A monophonic software sequencer developed as a class project for [CS4015: Software Architecture and Design Patterns](https://www.unb.ca/academics/calendar/undergraduate/current/frederictoncourses/softwareengineering/swe-4403.html) at
the [University of New Brunswick](https://www.unb.ca/).

## Installation

First, make sure Java 17.0.2 is installed. Then, download [the latest release](https://github.com/shanepelletier/sequence-o-matic/releases) and run the .jar by either clicking it or typing the following in a terminal:

```shell
java -jar sequenceomatic.jar
```

## Contributing

Since this is just a project created for a university class, I can't make any promises about maintaining the software.
However, I welcome any suggestions or Pull Requests and will likely merge any changes that don't require too much work
on my part.
